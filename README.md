# S-P-500-Project
This project is a scalable machine learning pipeline that analyzes all S&amp;P 500 stocks and provides Buy/Sell investment signals based on predicted closing prices. Using real-time data from Yahoo Finance, the system builds per-stock linear regression models to forecast price movements and compare predictions to actual market prices.
